** REACTIONS
# The reactions to be considered from AMJUEL/HYDHEL/H2VIBR listed below.
# The form of the data must be the following
# DATABASE_REACTION#
# Reactant1 + Reactant 2 > Fragment1 + Fragment 2 - multiple fragments are marked by multiplier N as N*Fragment
#

** RATES
# Define the files for the standard inputs
AMJUEL  rates/amjuel.tex # Inline comments now work too!
HYDHEL  rates/hydhel.tex
H2VIBR  rates/h2vibr.tex
UE      rates/ehr2.dat

** ENERGIES
# Define the file with energies and handles to be used in energy calculation
rates/energy_keys.dat


** SETTINGS
# Define the most central parameters to the simulations

# Maximum number of molecular vibrational levels to be considered
* vmax      14
# Maximum number of atomic excited levels to be considered
* nmax      8
# P-space size: P-space is built on the NW corner of the rate matrix.. 
# Thus, the first Np entries of species are considered to belong to the P-space.
# The Q-space is taken as the inverse intersect of N and P spaces
* Np        2

# Initial densities
# Species without specified densities are assumed to be zero at t=0
