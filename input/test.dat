** REACTIONS
# The reactions to be considered from AMJUEL/HYDHEL/H2VIBR listed below.
# The form of the data must be the following
# DATABASE_REACTION#
# Reactant1 + Reactant 2 > Fragment1 + Fragment 2 - multiple fragments are marked by multiplier N as N*Fragment
# 

* AMJUEL_2.1.5USE
e + H(n=1) > 2*e + p


** RATES
# Define the files for the standard inputs
AMJUEL  rates/amjuel_edit.tex # Inline comments now work too!
HYDHEL  rates/hydhel.tex
H2VIBR  rates/h2vibr.tex
UE      rates/ehr2.dat
ADAS    rates/ich0-1.dat


** SETTINGS
# Define the most central parameters to the simulations

# Maximum number of molecular vibrational levels to be considered
* vmax      0
# Maximum number of atomic excited levels to be considered
* nmax      0
# P-space size: P-space is built on the NW corner of the rate matrix.. 
# Thus, the first Np entries of species are considered to belong to the P-space.
# The Q-space is taken as the inverse intersect of N and P spaces
* Np        1

# Initial densities
# Species without specified densities are assumed to be zero at t=0
* n0
H(n=1)      0e12
* verbose   0   # Show verbose output
